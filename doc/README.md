# User stories

###  Drawing the sRGB gamut on the CIE xy plane

**As a** graphics programmer
**I want** to verify that I can reproduce the sRGB gamut
**so that** I can validate external resources.

###  Drawing the Spectral locus on the CIE xy plane

**As a** graphics programmer
**I want** to verify that I can reproduce the Spectral locus
**so that** I can validate external resources.
 
### Visualizing the sRGB gamut on the CIE xy plane

**As a** graphics programmer<br>
**I want** to see the sGRB gamut on the CIE xy plane<br>
**so that** I can have a better understanding of it.

### Visualizing the sRGB gamut in the CIE xyY space

**As a** graphics programmer<br>
**I want** to see the sGRB 3D gamut boundaries in the CIE xyY space<br>
**so that** I can have a better understanding of it.
